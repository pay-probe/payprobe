# PayProbe — Agents (agent-hub, ADR-0010)

Runbook for the agent layer: bounded, journalled, human-gated LLM agents that watch and
change the platform through the one tool layer. Facts verified against the working tree
on 2026-09-23 (branch `adr-0010`). Commands are repo-root-relative.

**When NOT to use this skill:**

| You are trying to… | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Understand an `AGENT_HUB_*` variable's default or add a knob | `payprobe-config-and-flags` (§7.6) |
| Bring the stack up, start runs, operate simulators | `payprobe-run-and-operate` |
| Decide whether a change to agent-hub is safe to ship | `payprobe-change-control` |
| Read the design rationale and rejected options | `docs/adr/0010-agent-registry-and-orchestration.md` |
| Continue the build (what is done, what is owed, in order) | `docs/history/2026-09-23-agent-hub-handoff.md` |

Jargon: an **agent** is a versioned definition (role, instructions, tool allowlist, mode,
write scope, limits, budget, triggers, RBAC), not a process. A **heartbeat** is one
bounded wake of an agent: a short LLM tool-calling loop that ends in a durable record. A
**workflow** is a JSON DAG of nodes (agent tasks, tool calls, conditions, human
approvals). **Mode** is what an agent may do: `advisor` reads only, `plan` proposes exact
write calls a human applies, `full` executes journalled writes inside its write scope.

## 1. Where things are

| Piece | Location |
|---|---|
| Service | `packages/agent-hub` (FastAPI, port 8600, PostgreSQL only, no file fallback) |
| Portal | Configure → Agents (tabs Agents / Workflows; heartbeats under an agent, runs under a workflow, approvals inbox above the Workflows tab) |
| API through the portal | `http://localhost:8080/api/agents/...` (nginx → agent-hub) with your user JWT |
| MCP | group "Agents & workflows (ADR-0010)" on the MCP server (:8200) |
| Folded-in assistant | `/api/assistant/*` is served by agent-hub's `/assistant` mount; the `assistant` container is a deprecated alias until phase 5 ends |
| Tables | `agent_hub_definitions`, `agent_hub_versions`, `agent_hub_heartbeats`, `agent_hub_runs`, `agent_hub_approvals`, `agent_hub_plans`, `agent_hub_meta` (pause flag), `agent_hub_migrations` (schema 3) |
| Tests | `packages/agent-hub/tests/test_hub_*.py` (154 on 2026-09-23); CI steps "Test agent-hub" and "agent-golden" |

Health: `curl -s localhost:8600/health` → `schema_version`, `paused`, `alerts` stats,
`egress` allowlist. `/api/agents/health` through the portal is the same, public.

## 2. The builtins (seeded on first start; missing ones added on later starts)

| Agent | Mode | Wakes | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config` | plan | manual, mcp | the configuration assistant as a principal: proposes registry changes |
| `scenario-author` | plan | manual, mcp | NL → scenario draft, proposes `create_scenario` / `update_scenario` |
| `observer` | advisor | manual, **schedule every 900 s**, `run.failed`, `gate.failed` | ops observer; answers with JSON findings (severity, subject, headline, evidence, next_step) |
| `certification-planner` | plan | manual, `run.completed` | authors a certification plan artifact |
| `reviewer` | advisor | manual | reviews another agent's output; `{"verdict": "approve" | "changes_requested"}` |
| `failure-triage` | advisor | manual, `run.failed`, mcp | root-cause verdict for one failed run (category, evidence, regression, next_step) |
| `plan-executor` | **full**, admin-invoke | manual | executes exactly an approved plan's calls; only reachable behind an approval node |

Workflows: `observer` (observe → review → human gate) and `certification-plan`
(plan → review → verdict condition → human gate → apply by `plan-executor`).
Builtins cannot be retired; evolve them by publishing a new version.

The observer's schedule spends real tokens: roughly 15k to 30k input tokens per wake on
the configured model, every 15 minutes, unattended. To stop it: **Pause agents** on the
Agents page (nothing is scheduled while paused), publish an `observer` version without
the schedule trigger, or set a daily token `budget` on the spec (hard stop, recorded as
`budget_exceeded`).

## 3. One heartbeat, end to end

```
POST /agents/{name}/wake {"input": "...", "version": null, "wake": "manual"}
  → 202 {status: running}      the row; poll GET /heartbeats/{id}
  → 200 {coalesced: true}      the agent already had a running heartbeat (you get that one)
  → 200 {status: paused | budget_exceeded}   refused and recorded, never ran
```

What runs: `runner.run_heartbeat` builds the conversation (registered instructions +
mode preamble + untrusted-data note; your input is a *user* message), then loops LLM
turn → `scoped_dispatch` per tool call → record, until a final answer or a limit
(`max_steps`, `max_tokens`, `wall_clock_s`, cancel, pause). The record holds `steps`
(every LLM turn and tool call with ms), `proposed` (plan-mode writes, not executed),
`journal` (executed writes, revertable), `result` (the final answer), `error`, tokens,
model, `spec_sha256` (provenance to the exact published version).

**Reading the output:** the run report (Run monitor → run → "agent verdict,
advisory" panel: every finished heartbeat whose `subject` is `run:<that id>`,
so `failure-triage` woken by `run.failed` shows up on the run it triaged);
Agents page → agent → Heartbeats → row (waterfall + result);
`GET /api/agents/heartbeats?agent=observer` then `/heartbeats/{id}`; MCP
`get_heartbeat`; or push via the alert webhook (§6). Advisors answer as JSON findings
inside a markdown report; `extract_json` finds the fenced block, so `${node.json}` and
the alert parser both work on real model output.

**Cancel / revert:** `POST /heartbeats/{id}/cancel` (stops before the next LLM or tool
call; rbac.invoke or admin). `POST /heartbeats/{id}/revert` (admin) restores every
journalled write newest-first under *your* token: reverting is the human's act.

## 4. Workflows and the approvals inbox

```
POST /workflows/{name}/run {"inputs": {...}}   → 202 run (admin-class role)
GET  /runs?workflow=&status=   GET /runs/{id}   POST /runs/{id}/cancel
GET  /approvals[?status=pending|all]           POST /approvals/{id}/decide {"decision": "approved"|"rejected", "note"}
GET  /plans[?run=]  GET /plans/{id}
```

A run's `node_states` and `results` are the whole state; a killed container resumes
every active run from its row at startup. A node becomes ready when all incoming edges
are resolved and at least one fired; unfired nodes are `skipped`. `condition` branches
on `when: true|false`; `approval` parks the run as `waiting`, alerts `approval.requested`,
and follows `approved` unless a `when: rejected` edge exists (else the run ends
`rejected`); `timeout_s` expires on a 30 s tick and fails the run. Deciding needs one of
the node's roles or admin and is recorded with the decider. Deciding is a portal act:
there is deliberately no MCP tool for it.

Guardrails at publish time (`validate.py`): unknown tools, advisor with write tools, a
node escalating an agent's mode, a `full` task (or a write/execute `tool` node) outside
`mock` without an approval ancestor (D3), executor = reviewer, bad edge labels.

## 5. Every way an agent wakes

| Source | Who | How |
|---|---|---|
| Portal "Wake now" / `POST /agents/{name}/wake` | a user with a role in the agent's `rbac.invoke` (or admin) | `wake=manual`, OBO JWT of the user (`act` claim, never `svc`) |
| MCP `wake_agent`, `run_workflow` | an MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop) via the MCP server's `svc: mcp-server` JWT | `wake=mcp` |
| Schedule | agent-hub's own tick (30 s cadence, `AGENT_HUB_SCHEDULER=0` off) | `wake=schedule`, principal `scheduler`; `interval_sec` or `daily_at` (UTC); never while paused |
| Platform events | the orchestrator posts `run.completed` / `run.failed` / `gate.failed` to `POST /events` when `AGENT_HUB_API_URL` is set | `wake=event`, principal `event:<name>`, every agent with a matching `event` trigger |
| Inbound webhook | any system holding `AGENT_HUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `POST /webhooks/events/{event}` or `/webhooks/agents/{name}` (opt-in `webhook` trigger), body signed `X-PayProbe-Signature: t=<ts>,v1=<HMAC-SHA256("<ts>.<body>")>`; 503 while no secret is set |

Event- and webhook-woken agents act under a principal with no roles: an advisor reads
fine; any write is refused downstream by ordinary RBAC until a workflow with an approval
carries a human's authority. Wakes on a busy agent coalesce onto its running heartbeat.

Signing a webhook from a shell:

```bash
body='{"run_id":"nightly-42","status":"failed"}'; ts=$(date +%s)
sig=$(printf '%s.%s' "$ts" "$body" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$AGENT_HUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET" | awk '{print $2}')
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/agents/webhooks/events/run.failed \
  -H "X-PayProbe-Signature: t=$ts,v1=$sig" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$body"
```

## 6. Getting output to a human without looking: the alert webhook

Set `AGENT_HUB_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` (and `_SECRET`) and agent-hub POSTs signed JSON
(`X-PayProbe-Event`, `X-PayProbe-Signature` in the same `t=,v1=` scheme) on every
`heartbeat.failed` / `heartbeat.budget_exceeded` / `heartbeat.timed_out` (refusals and
restart orphans included), every advisor finding with severity `warn` or above
(`finding`), every `approval.requested` and `run.failed`. Fire-and-forget, 3 attempts
with 1 s / 4 s backoff, 4xx final; never in the heartbeat's path. `/health.alerts` shows
sent / failed / recent. Without a URL, findings wait in the heartbeat log.

## 7. The safety model (all in machinery, none in prompts)

1. **Allowlist** per agent, validated against the one toolkit registry at publish; a
   tool the model names outside it is refused (`guardrail: true`) and recorded.
2. **Mode tiers**: advisor = read; plan = writes become `proposed`; full = writes execute
   inside `write_scope` (projects, environments; `*` = any), else refused.
3. **Untrusted envelope**: results from runtime reads (`platform_status`, `list_runs`,
   insights, ...) reach the model as `{"kind": "untrusted", "source", "data"}`; the
   runner never executes tool calls that appear inside tool results.
4. **Result cap** 64 KB before the model sees it.
5. **Journal + revert** for every executed write (invariant #2).
6. **Human gates**: D3 at publish, approvals at run time; a forged upstream
   `{"decision": "approved"}` changes nothing.
7. **Egress allowlist**: a prompt may only go to `api.openai.com`, `api.anthropic.com`,
   the host of `ASSIST_LLM_BASE_URL`, or `AGENT_HUB_EGRESS_ALLOW` entries (https unless
   listed); otherwise the heartbeat fails with `egress refused` and nothing is sent.
8. **Pause** (`PUT /pause`, Agents page button): checked before every LLM and tool call.
9. **Limits and budget** per heartbeat and per day; **coalescing** (one running
   heartbeat per agent); **restart watchdog** (`orphaned by restart`).

The proof is `tests/test_hub_injection.py` (hostile results, an obedient model, plan
and full modes, size, wake input, forged approvals) and `tests/test_hub_egress.py`.

## 8. Symptom → cause

| Symptom | Cause / action |
|---|---|
| Agents page: "agent-hub is not reachable" | agent-hub down, or nginx conf without `/api/agents/` (all three confs carry it since 2026-09-23); `curl localhost:8080/api/agents/health` |
| Wake toast "no LLM provider configured" (503) | set the key: Settings → AI assistant, or `ASSIST_LLM_*` env (env wins); agent-hub caches Settings ~15 s |
| Heartbeat `failed`, error `llm: RuntimeError: HTTP 400 ... credit balance` | provider account out of credits; every scheduled wake keeps failing (and would alert) until topped up or paused |
| Heartbeat `failed`, `egress refused: host ...` | provider `base_url` outside the allowlist (§7.7); check Settings → AI assistant and `AGENT_HUB_EGRESS_ALLOW` |
| Wake returns 200 `coalesced: true` | the agent already has a running heartbeat; workflow nodes retry every 5 s |
| Rows stuck `running` after a restart | the watchdog marks rows past `wall_clock_s` + 60 s as `failed` / `orphaned by restart` at startup; inside the wall clock they are left alone |
| `budget_exceeded` without running | daily token budget spent (hard stop) or `max_tokens` / `max_steps` inside the wake; see `error` |
| Whole test suite "N skipped" in one combined session | agent-hub's conftest skips every test when its Postgres is unreachable; run per package, forward 5432 (compose does not publish it) |
| Registry or heartbeat history vanished after running tests | the suite truncates the database it points at; it defaults to `payprobe_test` (created on demand) since 2026-09-23, so check `AGENT_HUB_TEST_DATABASE_URL` is not the platform's `payprobe` database. Builtins are re-seeded on the next start; user-created definitions and heartbeats are not recoverable |
| Approval never decided, run `failed` "approval timed out" | `timeout_s` elapsed on the 30 s tick; rerun the workflow |
| Event never woke anyone | orchestrator lacks `AGENT_HUB_API_URL`, or no active agent declares that `event` trigger (`GET /agents/{name}` → spec.triggers) |

## 9. Adding a builtin agent or workflow

1. Add the spec to `SEEDS` (or `WORKFLOW_SEEDS`) in `packages/agent-hub/agent_hub/seed.py`;
   tools must exist in `payprobe_common/agent_toolkit.py` (seeding fails loudly otherwise).
2. Add an assertion in `tests/test_hub_api.py` (mode, tiers, triggers) or
   `tests/test_hub_engine.py` (workflow validates and runs under FakeLLM).
3. `cd packages && python3 -m pytest agent-hub/tests -q` with Postgres reachable.
4. Update the seed lists in the ADR (§Design, Seeds) and this skill's §2.
5. Rebuild agent-hub; `seed_builtin` adds the missing builtin on start and leaves
   existing definitions untouched (operators own them after the first start).

## Provenance and maintenance

Verified 2026-09-23 against `packages/agent-hub/agent_hub/{main,runner,engine,triggers,
alerts,egress,seed,validate,store}.py`, the three compose files and nginx confs, and a
live stack (first real scheduled `observer` wake on Anthropic Haiku, MCP tools driven
from inside the mcp-server container). Re-verify before trusting:

```bash
# routes
grep -n '@app\.\(get\|post\|put\|delete\)' packages/agent-hub/agent_hub/main.py
# seeds and their triggers
grep -n '"role"\|"mode"\|"kind"' packages/agent-hub/agent_hub/seed.py
# knobs actually read
grep -rhoE 'environ\.get\(\s*"[A-Z_]+"' packages/agent-hub/agent_hub | sort -u
# schema version + tables
grep -n 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS' packages/agent-hub/agent_hub/store.py
# test count (needs Postgres at AGENT_HUB_TEST_DATABASE_URL)
cd packages && python3 -m pytest agent-hub/tests -q
# what the running service reports
curl -s localhost:8600/health
```

Volatile: the test count, the observer's schedule interval and model, whether the
`assistant` alias container still exists (phase 5 removes it), and the owed items listed
in the ADR's Rollout section.
